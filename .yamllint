# .yamllint
# Lints YAML files for consistent style and fewer “gotchas”.
#
# Notes:
# - We extend the upstream `default` ruleset, then tune a few rules for
#   readability and Ansible/GitHub Actions friendliness.
# - `truthy` is disabled because Ansible playbooks commonly use yes/no/on/off.
#
# Docs: https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/

extends: default
# Paths that are generated, vendored, or third-party and should be excluded from linting.
